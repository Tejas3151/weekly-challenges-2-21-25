# weekly-challenge
## Week 7 2025-02-28
Collaboration on Github
[Background info](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started)

### Preparation (No points)
1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/okinawa-ai-beach-robot/weekly-challenges) if you haven't already. Be sure to include all branches not just main.
2. checkout the wk7 tag

### Challenge 1 (1 Points)
#### A simple practical PR
1. Make the sample.py file print the returned value when run as `python sample.py` 
2. Create a pull request from your fork that includes:
    - A topic branch from your fork named `printSample`
    - Ensure the base branch is `wk7` from the okinawa-ai-beach-robot/weekly-challenges repo
3. Request Christopher to [review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review). Note, this is an action on GitHub not physcially asking me to review. 

### Challenge 2 (1 Points)
#### PR Review and Updates
1. After completing Challenge 1, Christopher will create a formal PR review of your work.
2. Make the requested changes to your PR. Hint: you can just create another commit and push it to your fork's wk7 branch.
3. Request Christopher to review again.

### Challenge 3 (2 Points)
#### Rebasing a PR
Often when collaborating on a PR, you will need to rebase it in order to incorporate changes from the base branch.
1. After completing Challenge 2, rebase your fork's wk7 branch onto the wk7-rebase branch.
2. Change the base of your PR from main to wk7-rebase as well.
3. You will now notice in the PR that there are [merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts). Fix these and push to your fork's wk7 branch with the fixes.
4. Ensure the exact same result from Challenge 1 is still printed when running `python sample.py`. 
5. Request Christopher to review.
